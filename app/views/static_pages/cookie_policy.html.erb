<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What types of cookies does Promo Posts use?</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We may use cookies to show you relevant advertising on the Promo Posts site. We may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who saw an ad later visited and took an action (e.g. downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on the advertiser&rsquo;s site. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie to determine whether we&rsquo;ve shown an ad and how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How are cookies used for advertising purposes?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. Note: Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Controlling cookies</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What to do if you don&rsquo;t want cookies to be set or want them to be removed?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you do not want to receive cookies, you can change your browser settings on your computer or other device you&rsquo;re using to access our services. If you use Promo Posts without changing your browser settings, we&rsquo;ll assume that you&rsquo;re happy to receive all cookies on the Promo Posts website. Most browsers also provide functionality that lets you review and erase cookies, including Promo Posts cookies. Please note that the Promo Posts site will not work properly without cookies.</span></p>
