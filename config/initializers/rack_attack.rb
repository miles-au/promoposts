  ### Configure Cache ###

  # If you don't want to use Rails.cache (Rack::Attack's default), then
  # configure it here.
  #
  # Note: The store is only used for throttling (not blacklisting and
  # whitelisting). It must implement .increment and .write like
  # ActiveSupport::Cache::Store

  # Rack::Attack.cache.store = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new 

  ### Throttle Spammy Clients ###

  # If any single client IP is making tons of requests, then they're
  # probably malicious or a poorly-configured scraper. Either way, they
  # don't deserve to hog all of the app server's CPU. Cut them off!
  #
  # Note: If you're serving assets through rack, those requests may be
  # counted by rack-attack and this throttle may be activated too
  # quickly. If so, enable the condition to exclude them from tracking.

  # Throttle all requests by IP (60rpm)
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:req/ip:#{req.ip}"
  
  throttle('req/ip', limit: 300, period: 5.minutes) do |req|
    req.ip # unless req.path.start_with?('/assets')
  end

  ### Prevent Brute-Force Login Attacks ###

  # The most common brute-force login attack is a brute-force password
  # attack where an attacker simply tries a large number of emails and
  # passwords to see if any credentials match.
  #
  # Another common method of attack is to use a swarm of computers with
  # different IPs to try brute-forcing a password for a specific account.

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by IP address
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle('logins/ip', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/login' && req.post?
      req.ip
    end
  end

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by email param
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/email:#{req.email}"
  #
  # Note: This creates a problem where a malicious user could intentionally
  # throttle logins for another user and force their login requests to be
  # denied, but that's not very common and shouldn't happen to you. (Knock
  # on wood!)
  throttle("logins/email", limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/login' && req.post?
      # return the email if present, nil otherwise
      req.params['email'].presence
    end
  end

  ### Custom Throttle Response ###

  # By default, Rack::Attack returns an HTTP 429 for throttled responses,
  # which is just fine.
  #
  # If you want to return 503 so that the attacker might be fooled into
  # believing that they've successfully broken your app (or you just want to
  # customize the response), then uncomment these lines.
  # self.throttled_response = lambda do |env|
  #  [ 503,  # status
  #    {},   # headers
  #    ['']] # body
  # end

  # Provided that trusted users use an HTTP request header named APIKey
  Rack::Attack.safelist("facebook webhooks") do |req|
    # Requests are allowed if the return value is truthy
    req.env['CONTENT_TYPE'] = ''
    Koala::Facebook::RealtimeUpdates.new( :app_id => ENV['FACEBOOK_KEY'] , :secret => ENV['FACEBOOK_SECRET']).validate_update(req.body.read, req.env)
  end

  Rack::Attack.safelist("test environment") do |req|
    # Requests are allowed if the return value is truthy
    if Rails.env.test?
      if ENV["THROTTLE_DURING_TEST"] != "true" || !ENV["THROTTLE_DURING_TEST"]
        true
      else
        false
      end
    else
      false
    end
  end

  # Lockout IP addresses that are hammering your login page.
  # After 20 requests in 1 minute, block all requests from that IP for 1 hour.
  Rack::Attack.blocklist('allow2ban login scrapers') do |req|
    # `filter` returns false value if request is to your login page (but still
    # increments the count) so request below the limit are not blocked until
    # they hit the limit.  At that point, filter will return true and block.
    Rack::Attack::Allow2Ban.filter(req.ip, maxretry: 20, findtime: 1.minute, bantime: 1.hour) do
      # The count for the IP is incremented if the return value is truthy.
      req.path == '/login' and req.post?
    end
  end

  # Lockout IP addresses that are hammering your create post page.
  # After 5 requests in 10 minutes, block all requests from that IP for 1 hour.
  Rack::Attack.blocklist('allow2ban micropost spammers') do |req|

    # increments the count) so request below the limit are not blocked until
    # they hit the limit.  At that point, filter will return true and block.
    Rack::Attack::Allow2Ban.filter(req.ip, maxretry: 5, findtime: 10.minutes, bantime: 1.hour) do
      # The count for the IP is incremented if the return value is truthy.
